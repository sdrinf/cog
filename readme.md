<h1>Announcing Cog</h1>

<b>Motto: No good substitution for understanding.</b>

Abstract: Cog is a PHP-based, minimalistic, and modular[2] web framework, targeted for rapid site development. Cog is based on the determination, that you must understand the tools you're working with in order to avoid the learning curve, scaling and maintenance pitfalls.

Cog is modular: you can decide to use whichever module you'd like to use in your project -dependencies are minimized.

Cog is also very beta. More documentation coming soon tomorrow.
